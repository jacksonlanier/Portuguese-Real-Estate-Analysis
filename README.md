# Portuguese Real Estate Analysis

## Overview
In order to better understand the Portuguese real estate market, I've conducted an analysis that explores the impact a variety of factors have on property prices. This analysis utilizes Python's ability to apply a variety of statistical analyses to nearly 100 thousand real properties available on the Portuguese real estate market. The results are presented in a Tableau storyboard that allows viewers of any experience level to better understand the market.

## Data Sources
The current real estate data I’ve chosen to use for this project provides information on Portuguese real estate listings and was sourced from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luvathoms/portugal-real-estate-2024). According to the description of the data provided by the creator, Thomas Gaehtgens, the data was collected by “legally and ethically” scraping various real estate websites. The data is licensed by [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/%7Eamini/LICENSE.md). 

Historical data on residential property prices was used during the analysis to better understand how the greater economy may impact individual markets. This data was sourced from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/QPTR628BIS). 

Geospatial analyses utilized data sourced from [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/gis/country/pt).
